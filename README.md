# panda-tutorial-for-data-analysis
pandas is an open source data analysis library written in python. It leverages the power and speed of numpy to make data analysis and preprocessing easy for data scientists. It provides rich and highly robust 
data operations ( remove duplicates, modify values, append, export to csv, read csv). 
Pandas has two type  of data structures:
a) series-- It's a one dimensional array with indexes, it stores a single column or row of data in a DataFrame
b) DataFrame-- It's a tabular spreadsheet like structure representing rows each of which contains one or multiple columns.
A 1D array(labeled) capable of holding any type of data-series
A 2D data(labeled) structure with columns of potentially different types of data.
